	<Method>
		<Name>Partitioning Around Medoids</Name>
		<Description>Partitioning Around Medoids method is based on the k-mean operation. The difference it's we no longer calculate the distance relative to the centroid but 
		relative to an element (this wich is the most representative of the cluster).
		The inconvenient of this method, it's th user has to indicate the number of clusters to found but it is a method wich is efficient on small databases.
